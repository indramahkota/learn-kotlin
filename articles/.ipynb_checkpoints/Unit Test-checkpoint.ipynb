    "Unit Test is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object."

    "For mocking objects, MockK has a simple method, which is mockkObject. It just takes the object as an argument, and it becomes a spy. With this method, we can use it as original works and can also stub and verify statements.\n",

    "\n",
    "To define what happens when the stubbed method is called, an answer function such as ```returns``` is used. ```returns \"Home\"``` tells MockK to always return the string ```\"Home\"``` when the ```currentLocation``` getter is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead to returning successful values, stubbed methods can ```throw``` errors. throws indicates that the following value should be an exception to throw, rather than a value to return. When the stubbed method is called in your tests, it will always throw the given exception instance.\n",

    "**@After**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like ```@Before```, ```@After```, or similar, allows you to add code which runs after every test. This is generally the place you do any cleanup, which if not done, would affect the result of the following test. This sits outside the GWT pattern."
